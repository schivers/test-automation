# Test Automation using pyATS
This project uses Cisco's pyATS testing ecosystem to provide a reuseable set of factory & Siite Acceptance Tests.

## Getting Started
These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine using the latest pyATS docker image supplied by Cisco.

### Prerequisites

What things you need to install the software and how to install them

```
install docker
```

### Download the pyATS docker image
The command below will download the image if you donâ€™t have it, instantiate the container, and give you an interactive shell into the container that now has your environment.
```
docker run -it ciscotestautomation/pyats:latest /bin/bash
```

### Test Scripts
#### Download my Test Scripts
```
cd ./pyats
git clone https://scm.dimensiondata.com/Shaun.Chivers/test-automation/testscripts 
```

#### Cisco Example Test Scripts (optional)
The Cisco examples folder is no longer part of the pyATS docker image so you need to download it (if you want some examples).
```
root@c1cac24ee8be:/pyats/pyats_intro# git clone https://github.com/CiscoTestAutomation/examples
```

## Running the tests
Use easypy, specifying the test jobfile and testbed file. One of the useful output switches is to generate an HTML report output
```
# Run a test job & generate local TaskLog.html output in /FAThtml
easypy network_test_job.py -html_logs FAThtml -testbed_file testbed.yaml
```
network_test_job.py = the test job file <br />
-html_logs FAThtml = generate an html output and place it in folder /FAThtml (optional) <br />
Testbed filename = testbed.yaml <br />
